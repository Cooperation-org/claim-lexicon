## Proposal Tagline  
**Building Verifiable Trust Infrastructure on ATProtocol: From Professional Credentials to Philanthropy Accountability**

---

## Proposal Description

Trust is failing in two critical systems: **professional credentialing** and **philanthropic accountability**. People cannot prove their skills without centralized platforms like LinkedIn, and NGOs publish impact claims that beneficiaries cannot confirm or dispute. Even the U.S. Secretary of State has recently highlighted the transparency crisis in foreign aid.

We are building **LinkedTrust**, a decentralized trust layer using ATProtocol that enables anyone to publish **verifiable, signed claims**, with others cryptographically attesting to them. These primitives support both professional identity and philanthropy verification.

### Why ATProtocol?

ATProto provides:

- **DIDs** for identity  
- **Signed records** for authenticity  
- **Content-addressing** for integrity  
- **AppViews** for verification and indexing  
- An ecosystem of 20M+ users  

The ongoing community effort around `community.lexicon.attestation` makes this the ideal moment to introduce a complementary, minimal `community.claim` lexicon for representing verifiable claims.

### Use Case 1: Professional Credentials

Users publish records like:

- “I have React development skills.”

Coworkers and bootcamps add **attestations** that validate the claim.  
All records are owned by the user and cryptographically verifiable by employers.

### Use Case 2: Philanthropy Impact Verification

NGOs publish impact claims:

- “Distributed 500 water filters in Kibera.”

Community members confirm or dispute these claims with evidence.  
Donors see *ground-truth attestations*, not unverifiable reports.

## What We’ll Demonstrate

- Live creation of **verifiable claims** using the `community.claim` lexicon  
- Attestations using the emerging `community.lexicon.attestation` standard  
- NGO impact verification workflow  
- AppView indexing of claims + attestations  
- Lessons from migrating from Ceramic to ATProto  
- Privacy-safe patterns for sensitive populations  

---

## Why This Matters

ATProto apps mostly revolve around posts and social interactions.  
We demonstrate ATProto as **trust infrastructure for the real world**, enabling:

- portable professional identity  
- transparent philanthropy  
- community-based verification  
- accountable institutions  

---

## Who This Helps

- Developers building trust or verification systems  
- Job seekers and students  
- NGOs and social innovators  
- Donors and auditors  
- Communities needing voice and agency  

---

## What Attendees Will Learn

- How to design cross-domain lexicons for verifiable claims  
- How ATProto signatures and attestations work  
- How to build AppViews for indexing trust relationships  
- A privacy-first approach to decentralized credibility  
- Real-world adoption strategy for trust infrastructure  

---

## Additional Details

We expect 20–50 real credentialed users and multiple NGO pilots by conference time.  
We will open a GitHub discussion proposing `community.claim` as a minimal LinkedClaims-style ATProto profile, contributing real-world feedback to the attestation lexicon effort.
